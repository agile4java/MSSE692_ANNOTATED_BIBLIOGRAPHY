					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With modern tools. it is possible to create a production 
grade, full-stack application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript alone. The
 combination of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js has become so 
popular that it has earned the title MEAN stack -- the subject of this 
book.This book explores the MEAN stack in detail. We will begin by 
covering Node.js, as it will lay the groundwork for all of our 
server-side work. You will learn how to get Node running on your local 
machine as well as download modules using npm. The key aspects of the 
Node.js programming model will also be covered.From there, we will move 
on to MongoDB, where you'll learn how to interact with Mongo from a Node
 application. You will also learn how to create, retrieve, update, and 
delete data from a Mongo store.After you have a solid grasp on Node and 
Mongo, the book will move on to the Express web server. We'll cover the 
basics of Express applications via topics like routes and middleware. 
Building on previous chapters, we will cover the integration of Node, 
Mongo, and Express.Our coverage of the MEAN stack will wrap up with 
several chapters on AngularJS. These chapters will cover Angular 
fundamentals like data binding, directives, controllers, routing, and 
services. In an effort to explore competing technologies, a slight 
introduction to Ember.js will also be provided.Full stack JavaScript is 
not fully encompassed by the MEAN stack. There is an entire ecosystem of
 JavaScript tools to learn about, and this book will introduce a few of 
them. We will cover task runners Gulp.js and Grunt.js which are 
extremely useful for automating mundane, repetitive tasks. We'll also 
cover JSHint, a linting tool used to improve code quality. Linting tools
 analyze source code and report potentials issues - a feature that is 
especially useful in non-compiled languages like JavaScript.</td>

						<td>Unlock the power of the MEAN stack by creating attractive and 
real-world projectsAbout This BookBuild six optimum end-to-end web 
applications using the M.E.A.N stackFollow the advanced Angular.js 2 
application structure to build more scalable and maintainable 
appsIntegrate an authorization system into your application and reuse 
existing code from projectsWho This Book Is ForIf you are a web 
developer with a basic understanding of the MEAN stack, experience in 
developing applications with JavaScript, and basic experience with NoSQL
 databases, then this book is for you.What You Will LearnBuild modern, 
end-to-end web applications by employing the full stack web development 
solution of MEANLearn NoSQL databases and separate the client logic from
 the server codeBuild a complex application from start to finish and 
work with monetary data in MongoDBHandle a multi-user type system and 
authorize your users to access control listImplement a chat application 
from scratch using Socket.IOCreate distributed applications and use the 
power of server-side rendering in your applicationsExtend a project with
 a real-time bidding system using WebSocketsIn DetailThe MEAN stack is a
 combination of the most popular web development frameworks 
available—MongoDB, Angular, Express, and Node.js used together to offer a
 powerful and comprehensive full stack web development solution. It is 
the modern day web dev alternative to the old LAMP stack. It works by 
allowing AngularJS to handle the front end, and selecting Mongo, 
Express, and Node to handle the back-end development, which makes 
increasing sense to forward-thinking web developers. The MEAN stack is 
great if you want to prototype complex web applications.This book will 
enable you to build a better foundation for your AngularJS apps. Each 
chapter covers a complete, single, advanced end-to-end project. You'll 
learn how to build complex real-life applications with the MEAN stack 
and few more advanced projects. You will become familiar with WebSockets
 and build real-time web applications, as well as create 
auto-destructing entities. Later, we will combine server-side rendering 
techniques with a single page application approach. You'll build a fun 
project and see how to work with monetary data in Mongo. You will also 
find out how to a build real-time e-commerce application.By the end of 
this book, you will be a lot more confident in developing real-time, 
complex web applications using the MEAN stack.Style and approachThis 
book is filled with independent hands-on projects that teach you how to 
build real-life end-to-end complex web applications using the MEAN 
stack.</td>

						<td>Over 50 recipes to create full-stack high-performance web 
applications using pure JavaScript and the MEAN stack.About This 
BookArchitect a fully functional stand-alone web application, including 
the web server, database, and front-end web applicationImprove the 
performance and maintainability of your MEAN stack application with tips
 for configuration and optimizationHighlights MEAN Stack best practices 
when working with your applicationWho This Book Is ForIf you are a 
JavaScript developer who wants to create high-performing, modern web 
applications with the MEAN stack, this is the book for you. Web 
developers familiar with some parts of the MEAN stack will find this a 
comprehensive guide to fleshing out the other technologies and skills 
they need to build all JavaScript web applications. Developers 
interested in transitioning from other web application stacks to an 
all-JavaScript environment will find a wealth of information about how 
to work in a MEAN stack environment.To get the most from this book, you 
should have a general understanding of web servers and web applications.
 You are expected to have a basic understanding of running JavaScript, 
both in a web browser and outside it, using Node.js and the NPM package 
manager.What You Will LearnBootstrap a new MEAN stack web application 
using Node.js and ExpressBuild a single-page application (SPA) with 
Angular and Angular-CLIImprove browser performance by optimizing your 
web application resources using WebpackModel complex JSON object 
relationships in MongoDB using MongooseDebug all the layers of a MEAN 
stack application, including working with source mapsBuild Restful APIs 
using Express.js and JSON Web Token (JWT) for user authenticationUse 
automated testing to improve the reliability and quality of your MEAN 
stack applicationIn DetailThe MEAN Stack is a framework for web 
application development using JavaScript-based technologies; MongoDB, 
Express, Angular, and Node.js. If you want to expand your understanding 
of using JavaScript to produce a fully functional standalone web 
application, including the web server, user interface, and database, 
then this book can help guide you through that transition. This book 
begins by configuring the frontend of the MEAN stack web application 
using the Angular JavaScript framework. We then implement common user 
interface enhancements before moving on to configuring the server layer 
of our MEAN stack web application using Express for our backend APIs. 
You will learn to configure the database layer of your MEAN stack web 
application using MongoDB and the Mongoose framework, including modeling
 relationships between documents. You will explore advanced topics such 
as optimizing your web application using WebPack as well as the use of 
automated testing with the Mocha and Chai frameworks. By the end of the 
book, you should have acquired a level of proficiency that allows you to
 confidently build a full production-ready and scalable MEAN stack 
application.Style and ApproachThis book is a guide of MEAN Stack 
specific solutions to common web application problems and includes 
in-depth guides for each layer of the application stack. Readers looking
 to upgrade their MEAN Stack web application will find recipes within to
 help them transition.</td>

						<td>Node.js, MongoDB and Angular Web Development  The definitive 
guide to using the MEAN stack to build web applications        Node.js 
is a leading server-side programming environment, MongoDB is the most 
popular NoSQL database, and Angular is the leading framework for 
MVC-based front-end development. Together, they provide an 
easy-to-implement, fully integrated web development stack that allows 
web programmers to create high-performance sites and applications built 
completely in JavaScript, from server to client.    Updated for Angular 
2, Angular 4, and subsequent versions, this new edition of Node.js, 
MongoDB and Angular Web Development shows you how to integrate these 
three technologies into complete working solutions. It begins with 
concise, crystal-clear tutorials on each technology and then quickly 
moves on to building common web applications.    You’ll learn how to use
 Node.js and MongoDB to build more scalable, high-performance sites, how
 to leverage Angular’s innovative MVC approach to structure more 
effective pages and applications, and how to use all three together to 
deliver outstanding next-generation Web solutions.    Implement a highly
 scalable and dynamic web server using Node.js and Express Implement a 
MongoDB data store for your web applications Access and interact with 
MongoDB from Node.js JavaScript code Learn the basics of TypeScript 
Define custom Angular directives that extend the HTML language Build 
server-side web services in JavaScript Implement client-side services 
that can interact with the Node.js web server Build dynamic browser 
views that provide rich user interaction Add authenticated user accounts
 and nested comment components to your web applications and pages

						<td>Learn how to build dynamic web applications with Express, a 
key component of the Node/JavaScript development stack. In this hands-on
 guide, author Ethan Brown teaches you the fundamentals through the 
development of a fictional application that exposes a public website and
 a RESTful API. You’ll also learn web architecture best practices to 
help you build single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web apps with 
Express.Express strikes a balance between a robust framework and no 
framework at all, allowing you a free hand in your architecture choices.
